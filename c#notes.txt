- Namespace 
    - namespace can be used with using keyword like using System;
    - used to organise our code.
    - collection of classes, interfaces, structs, enums and delegates.

- Main Method
    - entry point into the application

- We can write to console using two ways
    - Concatination
    - Placeholder syntax

- Built-types
    Boolean type 
        - only true and false
    
    Integral types
        - sbyte     -128 to 127
        - byte      0 to 255
        - char      U+000 to U+ffff
        - short     -32768 to 32767
        - ushort    0 to 65535
        - int       -2147483648 to 2147483647
        - uint      0 to 4294967295
        - long      -9.223.372036854775808 to 9.223.372036854775807
        - ulong     0 to 18446744073709551615

    Floating types
        - float and double

    Decimal types

    String types
        - Escape Sequence -> We can ignore one character by just putting a \(back slash) before it.
        - Verbatin literal -> We can ignore all the escape sequence in a string by putting a @ before the string.

    C# Types
    - Value Types - int float double structs enums etc
    - Reference Types - Interfaces Class Deligates Arrays etc.

    - By default Value types are non nullable .
        To make it nullable use int? j=0
        eg: string Name=null; (will work fine)
            int i=null; (will give an error as it is value type.)

    - Null Coalescing Operator ??
        When we want a value to be assigned for null value then we use this operator.

    Explicit Conversion
        - may result in loss of some data 
        - difference b/n using (int) & Convert.ToInt32 is that Convert.ToInt32 will throw an error when we want to store a large float value into integer 
            wheresas (int) will not ant returns the MinValue of integer.

    Parse and TryParse
        - Parse will directly try to parse a string into int and if the string doesnt contain a valid int value then it will throw an error
        - TryParse will check the string if it is a valid int , then only it will be sored to a variable
            eg: int.TryParse(strNumber,out Result)

---------------------------------
#Ref Video 8
    Arrays
        - Collection of similar data types.
        - Advantage - Arrays are strongly typed.
        - Disadvantage - Can not grow in size once initialized , have to rely on Integral indices to store and retrieve items from array.

    Difference b/n | and ||
        - if(UserNumber==10 || UserNumber==20)
        - In single or | if the first condition is true then there is no need to check the other but still it checks.
          In double or || if the first condition is false then only it will check the other 
    Difference b/n & and &&
        - if(UserNumber==10 && UserNumber==20)
        - In single and & if the first condition is false still it checks the second.
          In double and && if the first condition is false it will not check the other .

    Switch 
        - used to switch to multiple cases.
    break
        - if break statement is used inside a switch statemen , the constrol will leave the switch statement.
            so we dont use break after a goto statement.
    goto
        - we can either jump to another case statement or to specific Label.
    
    Note: Using goto is bad programming style. We should avoid goto by all means.

    Loops in c#
        - While loop -> checks the condition first. If true, statement in the loop get executed.
        - do while loop ->checks it condition at the end of the loop . 
            It means it guranteed to execute at least one time.
            used to present a menu to the user.

    Difference b/n while and do while
        - While checks the condition at the beginning , whereas do while checks at the end of loop.
        - guranteed to execute atleast once wheresas while not.

    while v/s for loop
        - In while loop we do initialization at one place, condition check at another and modification at another place
         whereas for loop has all these at one place.
            
    Foreach 
        - used to itirate through a collection(arraylist,hashtable,generics).
